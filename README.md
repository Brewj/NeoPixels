Playing With NeoPixels, Raspberry Pis and Node-Red for Christmas

I've been tinkering with some NeoPixels, and a bunch of Raspberry-Pis and I've been trying to get it all controled from Node-Red as this is my untimate aim for home automation.

I'm struggling with reading out the csv file and executing it through Node-Red every line has a space added to the end of it.  Anyone who can help me resolve this greatly apreciated.
